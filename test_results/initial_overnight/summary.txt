This test was performed by placing the raspberry pi receiver on a the desk
directly next to an nRF52 DK, and the nRF52 DK was flashed with the client
firmware application. The protocol is read data, advertise, and either
send the data if a connection is made or add the data to a buffer and send
all buffered data the next time a connection is made. The sleep interval
was 15 minutes between reading data and advertising. 

Results of this test showed that the RPi and the nRF52 DK can handle the
extended period of sleep, without fatal errors on either end. Also, every
connection was succesful through the duration of the test so no buffered
data was sent or received. 

The RPi was left on the desk at approximately 8:00pm. When examined the
next morning, the python application was still running without error.
However, the RPi could not connect via ssh and a reboot was required
to view the csv files. There may be an issue in which extended intervals
of perpetual BLE scanning could cause problems for other services, like
networking.
